# E-Cell VIT Bhopal – Test Member Portal

Live Demo: https://ecell-portal-sigma.vercel.app/  
GitHub: https://github.com/singhharsimar23-dotcom/ecellfull

A production-ready, full-stack member portal for Entrepreneurship Cell, VIT Bhopal .

## Features
- Stunning glassmorphism + dark gradient UI with Tailwind & shadcn/ui
- Secure JWT authentication with httpOnly cookies
- Personal member dashboard with profile & real-time upcoming events
- Exclusive access: Only @vitbhopal.ac.in emails allowed
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)

## Important Notes
- Only VIT Bhopal students can register (`@vitbhopal.ac.in` domain strictly enforced)
- Backend on Render free tier → cold starts possible (10–30 sec delay after inactivity). This is normal and will be upgraded with traffic.


## Tech Stack & Deployment
| Layer     | Technology                              | Hosted On     |
|----------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui   | Vercel        |
| Backend  | Node.js + Express + JWT + Mongoose       | Render        |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas                            | MongoDB Cloud |
| Auth     | JWT + httpOnly cookies                   | Cross-platform |

## AI Tools Used (Full Transparency — I Ship Fast)
- Cursor – code generation, components, refactoring
- Grok (xAI) – debugging, this README


## What I Personally Did (Real Full-Stack Work)
- Connected Vercel ↔ Render ↔ MongoDB Atlas end-to-end
- Generated & debugged MongoDB URI (escaping, connection pooling, timeouts)
- Fixed CORS, proxy, cold starts, JWT cookie issues across deployments
- Restricted registration to only VIT Bhopal emails
- Deployed, stress-tested, and iterated until zero bugs


## Installation & Local Setup
See detailed setup instructions in `/server/README.md` and `/client/README.md`

## Future Plans
- OTP email verification (Resend + React Email)
- Admin panel for event management
- Custom domain: ecell.vitbhopal.ac.in
- Migrate backend to Railway / AWS for zero cold starts
- Push notifications & member analytics

## Pages
- `/` → Hero, mission, events preview
- `/login` & `/register` → Secure auth
- `/dashboard` → Protected member area
